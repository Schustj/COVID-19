## A.Abstract (tl;dr)
## B.Introduction
This is a project for BIOL 390 Reproducible Research for the Summer semester of 2020. I'll be using data found from the CDC and data manipulating the results to give more clear insights on my hypothesis. 
## C.Hypothesis
Hypothesis: On April 16, 2020 seven states joined together to form the Midwest Coalition to combat the spead of COVID 19. These states include Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky. My hypothesis is the Midwest Coalition has effectively reduced the spread of COVID since it's creation compared to other states with similar populations.
