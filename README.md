## A.Abstract (tl;dr)
Summer 2020 Ferris State University reproducible research project looking at the Midwest Coalition States COVID death numbers/case numbers compared to states with similar population sizes. 
## B.Introduction
This is a Summer 2020 Ferris State University project for BIOL 390 Reproducible research created by Jonathan Schuster. 
## C.Hypothesis
My hypothesis is the Midwest Coalition has effectively reduced the spread of COVID since it's creation compared to other states with similar populations such as New Jersey, Georgia, Maryland, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Louisiana.  
## D.Datasets used
https://www.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases - Using Cases, and Deaths

https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Death-Counts-by-Place-of-Deat/uggs-hy5q - Using COVID19 Deaths

https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/US-states-population.htm - Used to find seven states with similar population sizes as Midwest Coalition States

## E.Description of analyses
How I compared data and what I chose look at. I chose two different databases originating from the CDC for credibility. One dataset I used to create two bar graphs. In these graphs I elected to show total death data from COVID19. From the other database I elected to show total number of cases due to COVID19 in the form of choropleth maps. I chose total deaths, and total cases to evaluate if the Midwest Coalition saw fewer case numbers, and deaths from forming a coalition. The forms of graphs and tables were chosen to give readers the easiest method to interpret my results. 
## F.Conclusions
Based off the data provided I agree with the null hypothesis. The Midwest Coalition has successfully reduced the spread of COVID since its creation. The Coalition saw overall less reported cases and fewer total deaths compared to Non-coalition states.
