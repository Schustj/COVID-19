## A.Abstract (tl;dr)
Summer 2020 Ferris State University reproducible research project looking at the Midwest Coalition States COVID death numbers compared to states with similar population sizes. 
## B.Introduction
This is a Summer 2020 Ferris State University project for BIOL 390 Reproducible research created by Jonathan Schuster. Data was found from several reputable datasets located from the CDC and used to better understand my hypothesis on the Midwest Coalition's COVID 19 response. R Studio was used to clean datasets, from the CDC, which were used to make physical reputations through graphs/tables.
## C.Hypothesis
Hypothesis: On April 16, 2020 seven states joined together to form the Midwest Coalition to combat the spead of COVID 19. These states include Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky. My hypothesis is the Midwest Coalition has effectively reduced the spread of COVID since it's creation compared to other states with similar populations such as New Jersey, Georgia, Maryland, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Louisiana.
