## A.Abstract (tl;dr)
Summer 2020 Ferris State University reproducible research project looking at the Midwest coalition covid response numbers compared to states with similar population sizes. 
## B.Introduction
This is a Summer 2020 Ferris State University project for BIOL 390 Reproducible research by Jonathan Schuster. Data found from several reputable databases will be used and then manipulated using R markdown to investigate a hypothesis pertaining to COVID 19.  
## C.Hypothesis
Hypothesis: On April 16, 2020 seven states joined together to form the Midwest Coalition to combat the spead of COVID 19. These states include Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky. My hypothesis is the Midwest Coalition has effectively reduced the spread of COVID since it's creation compared to other states with similar populations such as New Jersey, Georgia, Maryland, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Louisiana.
