 <!-- This initial chunk is loading all of the packages I'll be utilizing for my COVID report. Example, I'll be using the package "choroplethr" to set up choropleth maps as a form of graph. -->

 <!-- This chunk is uploading all the databases to my Rmd file. Files are from the CDC. I elected to use two different datasets from the CDC and you'll see below the ways I've elected to manipulate the datasets chosen.   --> 

```{r importing, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
data(state.regions)
myData <- read_csv("raw_data/US_MAP_DATA.csv", skip = 2)
myData2 <- read_csv("raw_data/Provisional_COVID-19_Death_Counts_by_Place_of_Death_and_State.csv")

```

 <!-- Manipulating data from myData2 from the CDC to show total deaths due to COVID in Midwest Coalition States. I'm selecting 2 columns that help answer my hypothesis, State and COVID19 Deaths, and renaming COVID19 Deaths to a simpler name "Deaths". After renaming, I'm filtering my data to the Midwest coalition states I've selected for my report. Lastly, I'm running a function to remove any NA's that exist in my dataset. You'll notice I'm saving this data into a new folder "output" after I've manipulated it. --> 

```{r data2stuff, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

covid19Data <- myData2 %>% select(`State`, `COVID19 Deaths`) %>% rename(Deaths = `COVID19 Deaths`) %>% group_by(State) %>% filter(State %in% c("Michigan", "Ohio", "Wisconsin", "Minnesota", "Illinois", "Indiana", "Kentucky") & !is.na(`Deaths`))

 <!-- Preparing to create a bar plot of death data due to COVID for Midwest Coalition States. I used the States as my x-axis and my total deaths on my y-axis. Geom_bar() is telling my ggplot to make a bar graph. Lastly, you'll notice the labs() function and that is to give my graph labels and a title. -->
